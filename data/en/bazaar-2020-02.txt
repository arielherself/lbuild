Acting is a job that helps me not only to find myself, but also to discover my own possibilities and to be open to many things, a mindset that helps me interpret my roles.

I can express myself with determination, especially in my work. So sometimes I think the profession of acting requires more communication skills, but I think sometimes you get so far around that you forget what you're trying to say. It should be the first time you want to express what you want to express directly.
