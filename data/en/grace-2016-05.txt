Acting well is my greatest interest. Acting is a subject that I want to spend my life studying.

Actors and teams want to have a good script, but sometimes they can't find it. Basically, I decide to do something and I dive into it. So any opportunity for me is a learning and a challenge.

I have a lot of respect for a good screenwriter who gives the director and the actors a deep creative blueprint; it's also important to have respect and communication between the director and the actors about the artistry. All three should be able to inspire each other creatively, while needing to protect the initial most cherished creative intuition that belongs to them.

Infinite, so challenging. There is no limit to what an actor can experience and learn.

Read books, run and rest well. I think what may be necessary to hold on to is being clear about what you really want. Everyone has different ideas, but as long as it's a dream that you think will bring out your greatest potential, you should go for it.

While sometimes time and growth don't always equate, to a certain extent there will be a different experience and the inner state will show up on the outside. So if you are a person who is abundant inside, the outer state will also be relatively more dynamic and comfortable. This sometimes has nothing to do with age, the years are memories and gifts that are unique to each person.
