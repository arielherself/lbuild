Yes, not only the duvet, I have a chair that I have used for 18 years and can not throw away.

Because it works really well with a smooth hand, because it must have a reason for using a smooth hand. For example, I have a bad cervical vertebrae, that chair can be just right for me to put my head on this side when dressed in costume, and very light, I will always carry it, the quality is very good.
