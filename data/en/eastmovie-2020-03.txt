I asked myself, "What can I bring to this story? Even though this is just an audition, I still hope I can present something unique.

You know, you create your own reality.

At that time it was just a fairy tale to me, but when I grew up as an adult, I understood the story not just superficially, but it contained a deeper level and could get some information from the story.

For Mulan, I asked myself, are you willing to open a door to the unknown? The answer was obvious, I couldn't wait, I wanted to understand her world, I didn't just want to play her, I wanted to be her.

Mulan is a very famous character, but I also want to be myself. It's about balance and choice, and being yourself is always a brave thing to do. When Mulan decided to take her father's place in the army, she didn't think she was doing a great thing, she was just following her instincts and she understood that anything was possible. It's very important for people to know what they want, to know who they are, to follow their dreams and be the best they can be, and I think that's the most important thing that young people can learn from this film.
