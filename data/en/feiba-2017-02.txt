The label, if it's there, it's there, not better. The audience of TV dramas is after all wider, in fact some people have not seen my recent works, but I think it does not matter, and I do not want to deliberately prove anything. I will keep on acting, and one day maybe people will see, oh, Liu Yifei turned out to be like this.

IP is sometimes a double-edged sword, there is a lot of attention, but also excessive preconceptions, how do I convince people, how do I convince myself, to stand up the image of the character? In the three months of shooting can not let up a day, there are ideas must be presented, but also to filter out unnecessary information, this is a brain work. In terms of fight scenes, what kind of power should Bai Shallow's animal nature be, her flirtation, her motivation, her roots, all these things need the character to be more realistic and more tense, not flashy is a guarantee.

The role of Bai Shallow can play in her age and her energy, that is to say, people live a long time, the heart is also big, but she has a blind spot, that is, she thinks that emotionally I am over, I see through, but did not think that they are in deeper than others. She also has an animal nature, instinctive and sincere, very direct, and no separation from people and nature.

Yes, most of the action is in contact with the ground.

There is still an animal nature in Bai Sha, so it is better not to be too vain, a little sense of power.

He kept telling me that I could do it, I was just nervous.

There is no danger, but it is inevitable that the body is bruised and battered.

I can afford this role.

The audience is pertinent.

If you are interested, you can see my work in theaters.
