It seems like every year is like a decade.

Always wanting to know how much I can surprise myself is what pushes me forward.

It's not as exaggerated as they say, it doesn't hurt to the point of tears.

It's all in the form of the actor doing the expression.

Sometimes the most challenging thing is that you have to forget so that you can have those reactions and explosive power.

I don't know if everyone is like this, when happy or excited, the body is like an engine, with a lot of power and energy. If there is no support in your heart, you may even feel tired sitting there doing nothing.

Maybe it's really being scared to cry, because it's really nervous.

When I was in school, everyone would say you must be careful not to get hollowed out.

There are very few lines, but there is a lot of hidden psychological activity.

The story of the character starts before the script begins. It looks like two simple strokes, but when you bring in all the information, it's actually quite rich.

You step into the role and realize that it is the role that is giving to you. Acting is a giving, and it's never a profession that empties you out.

I think those are their labels, I've always been pretty free myself. If audiences had seen my recent films, I'm sure they would understand.

Every time I hear people say that I'm breaking through, but in fact I'm committed to each role and don't think too much about breaking through or not.

It's new to me, not déjà vu.

I think we can call it that consciously for now.

But life is like that, it is impossible to have no emotional ups and downs.

Although timid, inexperienced, and green in every way, but because I feel like it, I have to continue to work hard, want to see where the direction of the dream is, and have a kind of spirit of not giving up.
